# MLeap Bundles

MLeap Bundles are a graph-based, portable file format for serializing and
de-serializing:

1. Machine learning data pipelines - any transformer-based data pipeline
2. Algorithms (Regressions, Tree-Based models, Bayesian models, Neural Nets, Clustering)

Bundles make it very easy to share the results of your training pipeline, simply generate a bundle file and
send it through email to a colleague or just view the metadata of your data pipeline and algorithm!

Bundles also make deployments simple: just export your bundle and load it into your Spark,
Scikit-learn, or MLeap-based application.

## Features of MLeap Bundles

1. Serialize to a directory or a zip file
2. Entirely JSON and Protobuf-based format
3. Serialize as pure JSON, pure Protobuf, or mixed mode
4. Highly extensible, including easy integration with new transformers

## Common Format For Spark, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow

MLeap provides a serialization format for common transformers that are found in Spark, Scikit and TF. For example, consider the Standard Scaler trasnformer (`tf.random_normal_initializer` in TensorFlow). It performs the same opperation on all three platforms so in theory can be serialized, deserialized and used interchangeably between them.

## Bundle Structure

At its root directory, a bundle has a `bundle.json` file, which provides
basic meta data about the serialization of the bundle. It also has a
`root/` directory, which contains the root transformer of the ML
pipeline. The root transformer can be any type of transformer supported
by MLeap, but is most commonly going to be a `Pipeline` transformer.

Let's take a look at an example MLeap Bundle. The pipeline consists of
string indexing a set of categorical features, followed by one hot
encoding them, assembling the results into a feature vector and finally
executing a linear regression on the features. Here is what the bundle
looks like:

```
├── bundle.json
└── root
    ├── linReg_7a946be681a8.node
    │   ├── model.json
    │   └── node.json
    ├── model.json
    ├── node.json
    ├── oneHot_4b815730d602.node
    │   ├── model.json
    │   └── node.json
    ├── strIdx_ac9c3f9c6d3a.node
    │   ├── model.json
    │   └── node.json
    └── vecAssembler_9eb71026cd11.node
        ├── model.json
        └── node.json
```

### bundle.json

```
{
  "uid": "7b4eaab4-7d84-4f52-9351-5de98f9d5d04",
  "name": "pipeline_43ec54dff5b2",
  "timestamp": "2017-09-03T17:41:25.206",
  "format": "json",
  "version": "0.20.0"
}
```

1. `uid` is a Java UUID that is automatically generated as a unique ID
   for the bundle
2. `name` is the `uid` of the root transformer
3. `format` is the serialization format used to serialize this bundle
4. `version` is a reference to the version of MLeap used to serialize
   the bundle
5. `timestamp` defines when the bundle was serialized

### model.json

For the pipeline:

```
{
  "op": "pipeline",
  "attributes": {
  "nodes": {
    "type": "list",
    "string": ["strIdx_ac9c3f9c6d3a", "oneHot_4b815730d602", "vecAssembler_9eb71026cd11", "linReg_7a946be681a8"]
  }
}

```

For the linear regression:

```
{
  "op": "linear_regression",
  "attributes": {
    "coefficients": {
      "double": [7274.194347379634, 4326.995162668048, 9341.604695180558, 1691.794448740186, 2162.2199731255423, 2342.150297286721, 0.18287261938061752],
      "shape": {
        "dimensions": [{
          "size": 7,
          "name": ""
        }]
      },
      "type": "tensor"
    },
    "intercept": {
      "double": 8085.6026142683095
    }
}
```

1. `op` specifies the operation to be executed, there is one op name for
   each transformer supported by MLeap
2. `attributes` contains the values needed by the operation in order to
   execute

### node.json

For the one hot encoder:

```
{
  "name": "oneHot_4b815730d602",
  "shape": {
    "inputs": [{
      "name": "fico_index",
      "port": "input"
    }],
    "outputs": [{
      "name": "fico",
      "port": "output"
    }]
  }
}
```

1. `name` specifies the name of the node in the execution graph
2. `shape` specifies the inputs and outputs of the node, and how they
   are to be used internally by the operation

In this case, the `fico_index` column is to be used as the input column
of the one hot encoder, and `fico` will be the result column.

## MLeap Bundle Examples

Here are some examples of serialized bundle files. They are not meant to
be useful pipelines, but rather to illustrate what these files actually
look like. The pipelines were generated when running our Spark parity
tests, which ensure that MLeap transformers and Spark transformers
produce exactly the same outputs.
