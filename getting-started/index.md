# Getting Started

Whether using MLeap with PySpark, Scikit-learn, Spark, Tensorflow, or
MLeap, getting started is easy. For the most part, everything you will
need is already in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/) or
[PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi). If you are trying to get up and
running with Tensorflow transformers, you will have to build some of
your own jars.

Experimenting with MLeap is easy to do either through an interactive
Scala console or preferably a notebook, whether from [Databricks](https://databricks.com/)
or [Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/).
